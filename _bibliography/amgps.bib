  abstract = {M-PESA, a mobile phone-based technology for transferring money provides a gateway to formal financial services for populations who otherwise would not have access. This study re-examines Jack and Suri's 'Risk Sharing and Transaction Costs' paper. With a few minor differences, the results are robust to consistency tests and sensitivity analyses. Since rural households are expected to particularly benefit from M-PESA, the heterogenous effects have also been explored by comparing benefits across urban and rural residents. The findings reported here and in the original study provide strong empirical evidence that M-PESA has had a positive impact on people's financial health. Such financial benefits derived from market-based mobile money innovations can be vital in combating world poverty.},

However, strong empirical evidence of how these benefits can be achieved is scarce, and recent research has found mixed results. A new randomized field trial replicates elements of previous studies and extends them by using an additional age-appropriate outcome measure. Methodologically, the results illustrate the challenges of carrying out replication studies because when target groups change, outcome measures also often change. Substantially, the findings suggest that a government initiative providing parents with materials and information to enhance parents' coproduction efforts can be extended to a broader target group of parents. Together, the findings illustrate how findings from single studies should be generalized with caution and the value of working systematically with replications and extensions.},

This study replicates a recent experimental study that fills this empirical gap by examining the effect of biometrically authenticated payments, 'Smartcards,' on India's two largest welfare programs (a work-for-payment scheme and a national pension program). We evaluate the original study's findings and obtain comparable outcomes - that Smartcards decrease the time lag for recipients to receive funds, reduce leakages of benefits and increase enrollment rates in the two programs. We also examine the robustness of the original study to outliers, alternative model specifications, changes in estimation methods and treatment effects heterogeneity bias.},

We conduct a Pure Replication (PR), a Measurement and Estimation Analysis (MEA), and a Theory of Change Analysis (TCA). In our PR, we did not find any major discrepancy with the original study. In the MEA, we generally find the results to be strongly robust to different types of alternative analysis. Finally, in TCA we explore a dimension that was not reported on the published version of the study and found that households with high initial levels of cement-floor coverage benefitted significantly less from Piso Firme's intervention. These findings are discussed in greater detail on International Initiative for Impact Evaluation's (3ie) working paper version.},

It also extends prior work by providing theoretical grounding through contingency theory and conducting the first empirical test of the situational contingencies of the SCALERS model. A positive relationship between each of the SCALERS variables and scaling-except replicating-has been found. Initial evidence of five contingencies that moderate the relationship between the SCALERS and scaling of social impact has also been found.},

Sociologists, however, have been largely absent from these discussions. The goals of this review are to introduce sociologists to these developments, synthesize insights from science studies about replication in general, and detail the specific issues regarding replication that occur in sociology. The first half of the article argues that a sociologically sophisticated understanding of replication must address both the ways that replication rules and conventions evolved within an epistemic culture and how those cultures are shaped by specific research challenges. The second half outlines the four main dimensions of replicability in quantitative sociology—verifiability, robustness, repeatability, and generalizability—and discusses the specific ambiguities of interpretation that can arise in each. We conclude by advocating some commonsense changes to promote replication while acknowledging the epistemic diversity of our field.},

Goodness in concept formation, I argue, cannot be reduced to 'clarity,' to empirical or theoretical relevance, to a set of rules, or to the methodology particular to a given study. Rather, I argue that conceptual adequacy should be perceived as an attempt to respond to a standard set of criteria, whose demands are felt in the formation and use of all social science concepts: (1) familiarity, (2) resonance, (3) parsimony, (4) coherence, (5) differentiation, (6) depth, (7) theoretical utility, and (8) field utility. The significance of this study is to be found not simply in answering this important question, but also in providing a complete and reasonably concise framework for explaining the process of concept formation within the social sciences. Rather than conceiving of concept formation as a method (with a fixed set of rules and a definite outcome), I view it as a highly variable process involving trade-offs among these eight demands.},

Van Ryzin experimentally manipulated expectations and performance and found a direct effect of performance, but no disconfirmation. We performed: an exact replication; a conceptual replication with extreme manipulations; a conceptual replication that reversed the order of a performance and expectations manipulation. Study 1 and 2 reproduced original findings. In contrast, study 3 indicates that expectation cues are retrospectively used to anchor prior experiences of performance. As the rational assumptions underlying the EDM are increasingly challenged, we need a better understanding of how cognitive biases shape citizen satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Serious concerns about research quality have catalysed a number of reform initiatives intended to improve transparency and reproducibility and thus facilitate self-correction, increase efficiency and enhance research credibility. Meta-research has evaluated the merits of some individual initiatives; however, this may not capture broader trends reflecting the cumulative contribution of these efforts. In this study, we manually examined a random sample of 250 articles in order to estimate the prevalence of a range of transparency and reproducibility-related indicators in the social sciences literature published between 2014 and 2017. Few articles indicated availability of materials (16/151, 11\% [95\% confidence interval, 7\% to 16\%]), protocols (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]), raw data (11/156, 7\% [2\% to 13\%]) or analysis scripts (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]), and no studies were pre-registered (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]). Some articles explicitly disclosed funding sources (or lack of; 74/236, 31\% [25\% to 37\%]) and some declared no conflicts of interest (36/236, 15\% [11\% to 20\%]). Replication studies were rare (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]). Few studies were included in evidence synthesis via systematic review (17/151, 11\% [7\% to 16\%]) or meta-analysis (2/151, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]). Less than half the articles were publicly available (101/250, 40\% [34\% to 47\%]). Minimal adoption of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices could be undermining the credibility and efficiency of social science research. The present study establishes a baseline that can be revisited in the future to assess progress.},

The results of the original paper are completely replicable and the findings of the original analysis are robust; however, we additionally find that treatments are more effective in the poorer province. We then extend the cost-effectiveness analysis by taking into account the parameter uncertainty in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Moreover, we provide information about the usefulness of additional research to reduce uncertainty concerning the cost-effectiveness analysis by calculating the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). Our extended cost-effectiveness analysis reveals that for some outcomes decision makers with a relatively small willingness-to-pay maybe a risk to choose a less cost-effective intervention. Furthermore, our findings indicate that further research into the comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions could be worthwhile. This is in particular true for low-resource settings where decision makers face stricter budget constraints to finance interventions. In particular, policy makers with a small budget have a high risk of choosing a comparably less cost-effective treatment. Hence, further research to reduce uncertainty of effect estimates could aid decision-making.},

Our replication study evaluates the impact of Zap delivery in contrast to more traditional delivery mechanism. We examined original author ' s findings and estimated similar results about increasing household diet diversity without decreasing their durable and nondurable assets. The heterogeneity evaluation by age groups suggests that the Zap delivery had a different impact on older beneficiaries than younger ones.

  abstract = {The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on the belief that success is mainly due, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills, smartness, efforts, willfulness, hard work or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well known that intelligence (or, more in general, talent and personal qualities) exhibits a Gaussian distribution among the population, whereas the distribution of wealth — often considered as a proxy of success — follows typically a power law (Pareto law), with a large majority of poor people and a very small number of billionaires. Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale (the average talent or intelligence), and the scale-invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind the scenes. In this paper, we suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, our simple agent-based model shows that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by averagely talented but sensibly luckier individuals. As far as we know, this counterintuitive result — although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature — is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. We also compare several policy hypotheses to show the most efficient strategies for public funding of research, aiming to improve meritocracy, diversity of ideas and innovation.},

Using the same programme features used to create the 'clecommodification index' in The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, one of the most widely cited sources in the field, we are able to replicate the results quite closely. However, our investigation suggests a number of likely errors in the original formulation. Once these are accounted for, we find very limited empirical support for the 'three worlds' typology in the decommodification data. Though some clear differences remain, there is also much less overall variation among countries. Furthermore, there is little evidence of 'clustering' among programme scores, a finding which is at odds with the idea of distinctive national regimes. Our results point to the need for a detailed re-investigation of welfare-state benefits in advanced industrial democracies. Our data set helps to provide a basis for such an assessment.},

Recent experiments on symbolic gender representation provide contradictory findings regarding the influence on citizens' co-production intentions. This study conducts a wide replication based on new data to reexamine the positive impact of symbolic gender representation identified by Riccucci et al. (2016, Public Administration Review, 76(1), pp. 121-130). The applied survey experiment closely resembles the original design aspects. The experiment is set in criminal justice policy, a policy field featuring co-production of core public services such as prisoner rehabilitation. The results do not confirm a positive effect of symbolic gender representation on willingness to co-produce. Instead, several arguments point to citizens' perceptions of uncertainty related to the co-production context and procedures as a boundary condition for the effects of symbolic gender representation.},

  abstract = {Today, ethnographers and qualitative researchers in fields such as urban poverty, immigration, and social inequality face an environment in which their work will be read, cited, and assessed by demographers, quantitative sociologists, and even economists. They also face a demand for case studies of poor, minority, or immigrant groups and neighborhoods that not only generate theory but also somehow speak to empirical conditions in other cases (not observed). Many have responded by incorporating elements of quantitative methods into their designs, such as selecting respondents `at random' for small, in-depth interview projects or identifying `representative' neighborhoods for ethnographic case studies, aiming to increase generalizability. This article assesses these strategies and argues that they fall short of their objectives. Recognizing the importance of the predicament underlying the strategies — to determine how case studies can speak empirically to other cases — it presents two alternatives to current practices, and calls for greater clarity in the logic of design when producing ethnographic research in a multi-method intellectual environment.},

In their poverty study in the German city of Bremen, Leisering and Leibfried found that more than half of all social assistance claimants were out of poverty within a year. Based on their work, individualization theorists such as Giddens and Beck argue that 'for most people poverty is only a temporary experience'. This article replicates Leisering and Leibfried's study using statistical data about social assistance claiming in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In doing so we find significant numbers of short-term claimants (about 30 percent), as well as surprisingly large numbers of long-term claimants. One in four Rotterdam social assistance claimants is poor for at least 5 years - more than twice as many as Leisering and Leibfried found in their study. We also show that recurrent benefit spells, for Leisering and Leibfried another typical feature of contemporary poverty, is only the exception in Rotterdam. Leisering and Leibfried (and sociologists such as Giddens and Beck in their footsteps) are wrong in claiming that short poverty experiences are typical for poverty in late-modern society. Persistent poverty is still present in our age and in our cities.},

We attempt to replicate and extend the investigation of this output bias through a pair of survey experiments involving judgments about two evidence-based, highly effective social programs: one, an HIV/AIDS prevention program (adapted from the prior study), the other, a program for special needs high school students (Check and Connect). Our findings confirm that respondents viewed both programs more favorably when given information about mere outputs (people served) in comparison with more rigorous outcomes (causal effects). We then tested an extension of the Check and Connect experiment in which we modified the framing of cost and performance information in ways that reduced the tendency toward an output bias. We speculate on the possible mechanism that may lead to an output bias, and we discuss the implications of our findings for evidence-based public policy and management.},

  abstract = {Replication is increasingly recognized as an important part of knowledge production in the social sciences, especially for experimental research. However, despite growing use of experiments, replication is little discussed or practiced in public management. We review the approach to replication taken by research in leading public management journals and note its scarcity. We then use a typology developed by Tsang and Kwan to classify the experimental replications undertaken by the articles in this special issue, which reveals a substantial variety of approach. We conclude by suggesting that replication is undertaken for different purposes and present a protocol about replication for experimental public management research.},

  abstract = {Haushofer and Shapiro examined the short-term impacts of Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) and the differential impacts by transfer recipient's gender, timing (monthly versus lump sum) and magnitude, using data collected in a randomised controlled trial from 2011 to 2012 in rural Kenya. The study found the UCT to increase assets, consumption, revenue, food security, and psychological well-being indices, but to have no overall effects on health, education, or female empowerment indices. Compared to lump-sum transfers, monthly transfers improved food security but reduced asset holdings. Large transfers, when compared to small transfers, increased asset holdings and improved the psychological well-being index. This replication study reexamined the main findings of Haushofer and Shapiro's and reported consistent findings on the overall effects of the UCT and the differences across treatment arms. These findings are sustained in rigorous robustness checks, however, the Principal Component Analysis results suggest a need for further examination of the method of measuring food security, health and psychological well-being.},

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

We explore the evaluation's theory of change, focusing on the result that first time export crop adopters benefit more from agricultural commercialisation than previous adopters. We also examine recall bias questions and provide sample size guidance for future researchers. Similar to the original paper, we find that the intervention mostly benefits households just entering the agricultural production value-chain.},
