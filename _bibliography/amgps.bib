  abstract = {Across the medical and social sciences, new discussions about replication have led to transformations in research practice. Sociologists, however, have been largely absent from these discussions. The goals of this review are to introduce sociologists to these developments, synthesize insights from science studies about replication in general, and detail the specific issues regarding replication that occur in sociology. The first half of the article argues that a sociologically sophisticated understanding of replication must address both the ways that replication rules and conventions evolved within an epistemic culture and how those cultures are shaped by specific research challenges. The second half outlines the four main dimensions of replicability in quantitative sociology\textemdash verifiability, robustness, repeatability, and generalizability\textemdash and discusses the specific ambiguities of interpretation that can arise in each. We conclude by advocating some commonsense changes to promote replication while acknowledging the epistemic diversity of our field.},

  abstract = {Nowhere in the broad and heterogeneous work on concept formation has the question of conceptual utility been satisfactorily addressed. Goodness in concept formation, I argue, cannot be reduced to 'clarity,' to empirical or theoretical relevance, to a set of rules, or to the methodology particular to a given study. Rather, I argue that conceptual adequacy should be perceived as an attempt to respond to a standard set of criteria, whose demands are felt in the formation and use of all social science concepts: (1) familiarity, (2) resonance, (3) parsimony, (4) coherence, (5) differentiation, (6) depth, (7) theoretical utility, and (8) field utility. The significance of this study is to be found not simply in answering this important question, but also in providing a complete and reasonably concise framework for explaining the process of concept formation within the social sciences. Rather than conceiving of concept formation as a method (with a fixed set of rules and a definite outcome), I view it as a highly variable process involving trade-offs among these eight demands.},

By elaborating a framework for replication studies, it contributes to an ongoing discussion about the appropriateness of various research methods. To exemplify this framework, the authors conduct a replication study on a specific topic relevant for nonprofit organizations in a globalized world, namely, media publicity for nonprofit organizations. The application reveals similar patterns for nonprofit organizations in the cities of Zurich, Switzerland, and New York, the United States, across a replication and original study, respectively.},

Steeped in experience and practice, this landmark text remains the first and best in research methods and statistics for students and practitioners in public-and nonprofit-administration. All statistical techniques used by public administration professionals are covered, and all examples in the text relate to public administration and the nonprofit sector. Avoiding jargon and formula, this text uses a step-by-step approach that facilitates student learning.}

  abstract = {Constructing Social Research: The Unity and Diversity of Method, Second Edition is a concise, innovative text designed for Research Methods courses in the Social Sciences. The main goal of this Sociology for a New Century Series text is to show unity within the diversity of activities called social research. The first part of the book tackles questions like "What is social research?" "How does it differ from journalism, documentary film-making, or laboratory research in the natural sciences?" and "What is the researcher's obligation to those he or she is studying?" The book also covers the how the various goals of social researchers shape the strategies they use and the representations of social life they construct. The latter part of the book is structured around the typical emphases of each tradition: qualitative research on commonalities, comparative research on diversity, and quantitative research on relationships among variables. These are not rigid divisions and research designs often blend aspects of each tradition in creative ways. Regardless of the approach, the process of representing social life through research involves a dialogue of ideas ("theory") and evidence ("data"). The model of social research put forth by Ragin and Amoroso is not as restrictive as the scientific method and encompasses social research ranging from research examining the complexities of everyday life to research investigating the power of transnational processes.},

However, despite growing use of experiments, replication is little discussed or practiced in public management. We review the approach to replication taken by research in leading public management journals and note its scarcity. We then use a typology developed by Tsang and Kwan to classify the experimental replications undertaken by the articles in this special issue, which reveals a substantial variety of approach. We conclude by suggesting that replication is undertaken for different purposes and present a protocol about replication for experimental public management research.},
