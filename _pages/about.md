### Overview

1. Understand basic quantitative and qualitative empirical analysis methods;
2. Able to conduct the analysis manually and with software packages;
3. Know how to apply these analysis methods to answering research questions from a research design perspective.

Required textbook: {% reference MeierAppliedStatisticsPublic2014 %} (previous versions are fine as long as the course content is covered)
