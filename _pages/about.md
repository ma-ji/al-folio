### Overview
---

Data crunching is hard, applying data crunching methods to empirical social science studies is harder. This course has <a name="purposes">three purposes</a>:

1. Understand basic quantitative and qualitative empirical analysis methods.
2. Able to conduct the analysis manually and with software packages.
3. Know how to apply these analysis methods to answering research questions from a research design perspective, and know how to assess the quality of an empirical study.

Given the background of students extremely varies, the overall expectations differ accordingly:

- Required to all: (a) understanding a set of core empirical methods, (b) the application of methods in policy research, (c) customized self-development over the semester.

- For students without or with minimal statistical training, approximately 9 hours weekly: (a) 3 hours in class, (b) 1 hour lab or self-guided session on Excel/Python/R, (c) 3 hours out-class for assignments (on final tests and "customized learning"), (d) 2 hours preparation for upcoming sessions (on readings and "paper practice").

- For students already with advanced knowledge of statistics, approximately 7 hours weekly: (a) 3 hours in class, (b) 3 hours out-class for assignments (mostly on "customized learning" and qualitative group project), (c) 1 hour preparation for upcoming sessions (on readings and "paper practice").
