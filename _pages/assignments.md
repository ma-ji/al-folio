# 1. Plagiarisms test
---

The first assignment of this course is to [pass the plagiarism test and obtain a certificate](https://plagiarism.iu.edu/index.html) at the master and doctoral level. Plagiarism is a serious academic misconduct. You will receive zero grade on plagiarized work and there may be other consequences. We have been told not to do this maybe since primary school, and we are always assuming we know what plagiarism is. However, we may assume we know too much (e.g., [famous cases of plagiarism](https://www.google.com/search?q=famous+cases+of+plagiarism)).

You do not need to take this test if you have comparable certification, but the validity of your certification needs to be approved by the instructor.

"All assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that compares submitted material to an archived database of published work to check for potential plagiarism. Other methods may also be used to determine if a paper is the student's original work. Regardless of the results of any TurnItIn submission, the faculty member will make the final determination as to whether or not a paper has been plagiarized" (Statement from the Faculty Writing Committee: Guidelines for Preventing Plagiarism).

_For this assignment, please submit your certificate as a file via Canvas_

# 2. Participation
---

## 2.1 Reading annotation (5 points)

You are expected to read and [annotate](#) the course materials of each week before class. The purpose is to have a chance to interact with your classmates, and I will have a better idea of your "pain points" before class. At least have one comment on each article, and respond to at least one comment from another classmate. This regular on-going assignment uses online annotation platform, and is due before the class day.

## 2.2 In class participation (5 points)

Your participation is assessed by the instructor and TA based on your performance in class during the lecture, practice, and TA sessions.

<br>

---
# 3. Customized learning
---

You may want to develop your own skill set over the semester. For example, learning how to use Python and R rather than using Stata or Excel. This assignment accommodates such a need. This is a DIY and self-motivated module.

<br>

## 3.1 Learning plan proposal (5 points)

You are responsible to develop an actionable and feasible learning plan. There is no required structure of the plan, but it should meet the following criteria:

1. Be concrete about your overall learning goals.
2. Break down your overall goals into specific and actionable items.
3. The plan should cover the major themes of our weekly sessions.
4. A feasible timeline.
5. A concrete plan for assessing your performance.
6. Maximum length 2 pages, use the space efficiently.

You can share learning plans with others. You can even assemble learning groups. But this is NOT a group assignment, and you will be assessed individually.

_The draft proposal is due on xxx; final version is due on xxx. You cannot substantially revise your proposal to lower the requirements after it is finalized._

<br>

## 3.2 Completion (15 points)

You will assess your own performance using the evaluation plan you proposed.

_Please submit a self-evaluation report for this assignment._

# 4. Replication projects
---

Replication is critical to scientific discovery, however, a substantial mount of studies cannot be replicated, leading to the so-called "reproducibility crisis'' in both natural and social sciences {% cite Baker500scientistslift2016 Hardwickeempiricalassessmenttransparency2020 %}. The replication projects serve two purposes: 1) get familiar with real-word research practices, which are often messy and unclear; 2) practice the empirical methods we learned in class. The reading materials in the first week are important to guiding the replication exercises.

Both the individual and group replication projects are required. The individual project intends to be simpler, help you get familiar with how to do a replication. The group project is more complex in terms of analysis or the number of empirical studies should be include. It is totally fine and encouraged to include or utilize your individual project in your group project.

<br>

## 4.1 Individual replication project (20 pints)

You will need to identify one or multiple empirical studies from renowned journals in the area of your interest. Your individual replication project should be in the "verifiability" category or above {% cite FreeseReplicationSocialScience2017 -l 152 %}. 

The replication report will be evaluated from the following perspectives:

1. Clear data management and documentation;
2. Replication results. If fail to replicate, point out possible reasons.
3. The following components are required in your replication plan: (a) descriptive statistics, (b) hypothesis testing, (c) regression analysis.
4. The following methods are optional in replication: qualitative interviews and coding, additional surveys.

<br>

## 4.2 Group replication project

Treat the group replication project as a serious manuscript to be submitted to an academic journal. It needs to be in the "robustness" category or above {% cite FreeseReplicationSocialScience2017 -l 152 %}. If you hope a better chance of acceptance, set your target high and also be realistic. A good project needs to be a finished project in the first place. Maximum 5 students per group.

### 4.2.1 Project plan (5 points)

TBD.

### 4.2.2 Draft manuscript (30 points)

The draft manuscript will be evaluated using the criteria for assessing the individual replication report, plus the following: 

1. Validation of original analysis, including empirical methods, instruments, and conclusions;
2. Your novel contributions; 
3. Effective teamwork and project management.

### 4.2.3 In class presentation (10 points)

Present your group replication project in class. Your presentation will be assessed using the criteria for evaluating your individual and group manuscripts.

<br>

## 4.3 Replication examples

The replication movement has been progressing very well in psychology, but you should be able to find replication studies in policy and public administration related areas. Here are some resources for your reference:

- [Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/)
- [Mass Replications & Extensions (social psychology)](https://mgto.org/pre-registered-replications/)
- "Cited by" articles of the course readings

<br>

## 4.4 Choosing the right article(s) for replication

You should keep three criteria in mind while searching for the articles for replication {% cite StojmenovskaTeachingReplicationGraduate2019 -l 305 %}: 

1. Interest. You are motivated to replicate the study.
2. Impact. The article should be published in a disciplinary flagship journal and/or highly cited, making sure you are "learning from the best."
3. Feasibility. Your replication plan should be feasible regarding data access and complexity of analysis.

TBD.
