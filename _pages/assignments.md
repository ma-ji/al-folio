# Plagiarisms test
----

The first assignment of this course is to [pass the plagiarism test and obtain a certificate](https://plagiarism.iu.edu/index.html) at the master and doctoral level. Plagiarism is a serious academic misconduct. You will receive zero grade on plagiarized work and there may be other consequences. We have been told not to do this maybe since primary school, and we are always assuming we know what plagiarism is. However, we may assume we know too much (e.g., [famous cases of plagiarism](https://www.google.com/search?q=famous+cases+of+plagiarism)).

You do not need to take this test if you have comparable certification, but the validity of your certification needs to be approved by the instructor.

"All assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that compares submitted material to an archived database of published work to check for potential plagiarism. Other methods may also be used to determine if a paper is the studentâ€™s original work. Regardless of the results of any TurnItIn submission, the faculty member will make the final determination as to whether or not a paper has been plagiarized" (Statement from the Faculty Writing Committee: Guidelines for Preventing Plagiarism).

_For this assignment, please submit your certificate as a file via Canvas_


# Participation
---

## Reading annotation (5 points)

You are expected to read and [annotate](#) the course materials of each week before class. The purpose is to have a chance to interact with your classmates, and I will have a better idea of your "pain points" before class. At least have one comment on each article, and respond to at least one comment from another classmate. This regular on-going assignment uses online annotation platform, and is due before the class day.

## In class participation (5 points)

Your participation is assessed by the instructor and TA based on your performance in class during the lecture, practice, and TA sessions.


# Customized learning
---

You may want to develop your own skill set over the semester. For example, learning how to use Python and R rather than using Stata. This assignment accommodate such a need.

## Learning plan (10 points)

You are responsible to develop an actionable and feasible learning plan. There is no required structure of the plan, but it should meet the following criteria:

1. Be concrete about your overall learning goals.
2. Break down your overall goals into specific and actionable items.
3. The plan should cover the major themes of our weekly sessions.
4. A feasible timeline.
5. A concrete performance evaluation plan.
6. Maximum length 2 pages, use the space efficiently.

You can share learning plans with others. You can even assemble learning groups. But this is NOT a group assignment.

The draft plan is due on xxx; final version is due on xxx. You cannot substantially revise your plan to lower the requirements after the plan is finalized.
