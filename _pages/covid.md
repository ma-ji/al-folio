In-person teaching is an essential part of high-quality education. But given the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and following the instructions from the University, we will make the following teaching adjustments.

# First three weeks (8/25--9/17): Online teaching + in-person office hours

1. We will meet during our regular course time on Zoom for the first three weeks. 
2. We also make weekly in-person experience accessible to everyone in the form of outdoor office hours. We will be [meeting here](/assets/img/office_hour.JPG) from 3pm-5pm on Friday afternoons. This session is optional. Wearing a mask is still strongly recommended and appointment is required ([make your appointment here](#)).
3. We will record the online session for the first three weeks.

# After the first three weeks (9/18--)

We aim to switch to regular in-person teaching, but will follow the University's policy.

**_For protecting our community, we strongly recommend everyone who are eligible to wear a mask and get vaccinated._**
