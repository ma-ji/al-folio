In-person teaching is an essential part of high-quality education. But given the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and following the instructions from the University, we will make the following teaching adjustments.

## First three weeks (8/25--9/17): Online teaching + outdoor in-person office hours
---

1. **Online synchronous teaching**: We will meet during our [regular course time on Zoom](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1311365/external_tools/51041) for the first three weeks. 
2. **Outdoor in-person office hours**: We also make weekly in-person experience accessible to everyone in the form of outdoor office hours. This session is from 3pm to 5pm on Friday afternoons and is optional. Wearing a mask is still strongly recommended and [appointment is required (`office hour` sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTtRQwt6XPxe62AXGHzdDKFAFL9LX7BB1R-M8kk95Sw/edit?usp=sharing). We will be meeting in the **lobby at the front of SRH3.318**.
3. We will record the online session for the first three weeks.

## After the first three weeks (9/18--)

We aim to switch to regular in-person teaching, but will follow the University's policy.

**_For protecting our community, we strongly recommend everyone who are eligible to wear a mask, get tested, and get vaccinated._**
