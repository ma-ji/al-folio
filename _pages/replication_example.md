## Typology of replication studies
---

My colleague [Dr. RenÃ© Bekkers](https://renebekkers.wordpress.com/) gave a clear summary of different types of replication studies according to {% cite FreeseReplicationSocialScience2017 -l 152 %} in his course _[Replication and Preregistration in Social Science](https://osf.io/bh3yp/)_:

>- You conduct a **verification**: from the description of the decisions with respect to the preprocessing and analysis of the data in the paper, you try to reproduce the results reported. This is a good format when the paper reports on data made available to you by the author(s), but there is no code. Which decisions are crucial in order to obtain the results reported?

>- You conduct a **robustness** analysis, e.g. by a multiverse analysis examining how alternative decisions in data preparation, analytical strategy, and model specification affect the findings. This is a good format when the paper reports on available data and code. Among all the possible analyses, how unique are the findings in the analysis as originally reported?

>- You conduct a **repetition** by analyzing different data. Are the results for the different data set similar to the results reported in the original article? Are the results significantly different?
>	- The paper reports on data and code that is available, and you find an alternative data set including similar information.
>	- The paper reports on data that is not available, but you find an alternative data set including identical (or at least similar) data on different units. You conduct a repetition, for instance by analyzing a later or earlier edition of the same (panel) study in the same country; a different data set from the same country and the same year; a data set from a different country in the same year. 
>	- The paper reports on publicly data from a single country embedded in a multinational dataset, such as the ESS, the EVS, the WVS, or the ISSP. You select a different country for which you can do the same analysis. 
>	- The paper reports a study that you run again in an online setting, e.g. through MTurk, Crowdflower, Prolific, or some other platform.

>- You conduct a **generalization** by analyzing different data with different methods. Find another dataset with similar yet slightly different measures, collect new data with modifications to the original protocol, or analyze new data with different methods or statistical models.

These example articles are generated through [Web of Science](https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/db/370) by 1) searching "replication" in the title field and 2) specifying the "Web of Science Categories". You can use this strategy and other keywords to generate more relevant articles in the areas of your interest.
