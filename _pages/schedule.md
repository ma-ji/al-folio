<!-- A typical weekly session will have three components:

1. **Lecture on reading materials and statistics.** During the first hour, I will typically give a lecture to cover the major points of the week. I will also answer any of your questions.

2. **In class practice on empirical methods.** We will solve problems and practice empirical methods in class.

3. **In class preparation and presentation.** The last hour helps you prepare your replication project. -->

\*\: Attendance optional if **_Early-Pass_** the [Standard Test - Quantitative](/test_quant/).
