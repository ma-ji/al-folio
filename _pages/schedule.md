# Session structure

How are we going to spend the 3-hour every week? The structure of weekly session ties to our [course purposes](/#purposes).

1. _Lecture on reading materials and statistics._ During the first hour of each week, I will typically give a lecture to cover the major points of the week. I will also answer any of your questions.

2. _In class practice on empirical methods_. We will solve problems and practice empirical methods in class.

3. _In class preparation and presentation._ The last hour helps you prepare your individual and group replication projects.

See weekly schedule below.
