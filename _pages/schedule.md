# Session structure

How are we going to spend the 3-hour every week? The structure of weekly session ties to our [course purposes](/#purposes).

## Lecture on reading materials and statistics (1st hour)

You are expected to read and [annotate](#) the course materials of each week before class. The purpose is to have a chance to interact with your classmates, and I will have a better idea of your "pain points" before class.

During the first hour of each week, I will typically give a lecture on the major points of the week. I will also answer any of your questions.

## In class practice on empirical methods (2nd hour)

We will solve problems in the second hour. 

## In class preparation for group and final projects
