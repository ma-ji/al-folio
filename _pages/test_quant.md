This is a partial open-book test. You can review and practice on these questions using the sample dataset. A different dataset will be provided when you take the final test, but the questions will remain largely the same. 

There will be two opportunities to take the final test.

- **_Early-Pass, Week 4_: If you are very familiar with these topics, you can take the final test during office hours.**
	- If you pass the test with A- or above:
		1. Attendance for [selected weeks](/schedule/) is optional.
		2. The [Research Replication](#4-research-replication) is required to be your final project.
		3. You need to meet TA at office hours to report and discuss your replication project weekly.
	- If below A-:
		1. No second chance to take the test again.
		2. Attendance for Weeks 4-9 is required.
		3. You have the option to do the [Research Replication](#4-research-replication) as your final project. If you choose to do the Replication, you need to meet TA at office hours to report and discuss your replication project weekly.
	- For all conditions, the assignment on which you are scored higher will be counted toward your final grade for this course.
- **On Dec xxx, 2022: This is the final and only chance for those who haven't taken this test.**

# Sample questions

1. Read or open the dataset using the analysis program of your choice (code, screenshot of the data).

2. Describe the dataset: 
	2.1 Explain the meaning of all variables.
	2.2 What is the unit of analysis?

3. Analyze missing data, how are you going to treat them, and why?

4. Descriptive analysis of variables xxx:
	4.1 A table shows the mean, standard deviation, min, max, percentiles (25%, 50%, and 75%). 
	4.2 Frequency distribution (histogram figure).

5. Are the means of xxx and xxx substantially different? What are the confidence intervals of the two variables? Draw a bar chart showing the means and CIs.

6. Analysis of correlation between two variables, report correlation coefficient and draw scatter plot.

7. Multivariate regression using raw values and z-score. Show the results in a table, interpret the results and alternative explanations.

8. Fixed-effect regression using raw values and z-score. Show the results in a table, interpret the results and alternative explanations.

9. Compare the results of 7 and 8, interpret the difference.
