Start to choose the article for your individual replication project. Prepare either one of the following items or all the items for sharing next week. The general idea of this task is to push you to start--"Rome wasn't built in a day."

- An oral introduction about your replication interests, directions, and methods, etc.
- An oral introduction about the article(s) you may choose, why you choose them, and your replication plan.
- A presentation about your replication plan (rough draft).
