## Prepare articles for replications

Start to choose the article for the replication project. Prepare either ONE of the following items OR all the items for sharing next week. The general idea of this task is to push you to start--"Rome wasn't built in a day."

- An oral introduction about your replication interests, directions, and methods, etc.
- An oral introduction about the article(s) you may choose, why you choose them, and your replication plan.
- A short rough presentation about your replication plan.

_This after-class activity is NOT for grading, just for in-class sharing and discussion. This activity helps you prepare the replication plan, but it is NOT the replication plan. The articles you select are tentative. You can do it either individually or in a group. If you do this activity in a group, this activity helps you form a group, but the group may NOT be the final group for the replication project._
