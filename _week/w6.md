# Key concepts
---

- Discrete and continuous variables
- Z-scores, also reflect on mean and standard deviation
- Binominal probabilities:
  - Independence, mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive
  - Combination: notation and calculation
  - Remember: $$ Probability Of An Event Happening = \frac{Number Of Ways It Can Happen}{Total Number of Outcomes} $$
- Distribution tables

<!-- - Probability and Bayes' Rule {% cite BruceHansenProbability %} -->
<!-- - Distributions: Normal, Poisson, and binomial {% cite MeierAppliedstatisticspublic2015 %} -->

## Required readings

Primary reading material:

- {% reference MeierAppliedstatisticspublic2015 %}. **Read Chapters 7 and 8 in detail, quick scan Chapter 9.**

Briefly review the following readings to get familiar with the notation and calculation. If you find the calculation and notation are hard to comprehend, try to understand what they are about and what they try to achieve.

- Properties of probabilities and Bayes Rule - Summary 
- {% reference BruceHansenProbability %}, Chapter 1
- {% reference WonnacottIntroductorystatistics1990 %}, Chapters 3.1-3.6, 4.1-4.2, 5.1 & 5.3
