# Key concepts
---

- Dependent and independent variable
- Slope (regression coefficient) and intercept
- Goodness of fit
- Residual variation and standard error of the estimate
- Coefficient of determination r-squared
- Standard error of the slope
- Assumptions of linear regression
   - Errors Normally distributed
   - Homoskedasticity
   - Errors are independent of each other
   - Independent and dependent variables must be interval variables
   - Linear relationship between variables
