# 4. Research replication
---

Replication is critical to scientific discovery, however, a substantial mount of studies cannot be replicated, leading to the so-called "reproducibility crisis'' in both natural and social sciences {% cite Baker500scientistslift2016 Hardwickeempiricalassessmenttransparency2020 %}. The replication projects serve two purposes: 1) get familiar with real-word research practices, which are often messy and unclear; 2) practice the empirical methods we learned in class. The reading materials in the first week are important to guiding the replication exercises.

Treat the group replication project as a serious manuscript to be submitted to an academic journal. Set your target high and also be realistic. *A good project needs to be a finished project in the first place.*

_Expected deliverables_:

<!-- **Maximum 4 students per group.** -->

	- Replication plan.
	- Presentation of your replication plan in class.
	- Presentation of your replication study.
	- Replication report.

## 4.1 Plan your replication (15%)

### 4.1.1 Choose the right article(s) for replication

You should keep three criteria in mind while searching for the articles for replication {% cite StojmenovskaTeachingReplicationGraduate2019 -l 305 %}: 

1. Interest. You are motivated to replicate the study.
2. Impact. The article should be published in a disciplinary flagship journal and/or highly cited, making sure you are "learning from the best."
3. Feasibility. Your replication plan should be feasible regarding data access and complexity of analysis.

### 4.1.2 Replication plan

You can think from five aspects while writing your replication plan: "(1) the premise of the paper, (2) the data and empirical design, (3) the key results, (4) why [you] think the paper would be a good candidate for the replication course, and (5) potential problems that might arise in the replication" {% cite StojmenovskaTeachingReplicationGraduate2019 -l 306 %}. 

A substantial part of the replication plan will go to your final replication report. The contents of the plan may vary, but they should include (but not limited to):

1. Significance of replicating the article(s) and your novel contribution.
2. Analysis of the original article from: a) theorization, b) research design (e.g., hypothesis and operationalization), c) analysis methods, d) results and conclusions, e) data management and documentation ([data management checklist](https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9KqVV6FMxAcW5lY)).
3. Replication plan: How are you going to replicate and extend the original study? You can develop the plan using the structure for analyzing the original article.
	- The following components are required in your replication plan: (a) descriptive statistics, (b) hypothesis testing, (c) regression analysis.
	- The following methods are optional in replication: qualitative interviews and coding, additional surveys, computational social science methods.
4. Expected results in comparison to original article.
5. Knowledge necessary for replicating the article, and how the knowledge is connected to your learning plan (explain by group member). You may not understand all the analysis methods used in the original article, set a plan to learn the new skills.
6. Effective teamwork and project management plan. Not all of the members need to be good at running an advanced statistical analysis or designing a rigorous empirical study, but you need to identify your strength and know how to collaborate with and complement each other. This is a more realistic scenario in the future regardless of the career you hope to pursue.

### 4.1.3 Present your replication plan

Prepare a 10-minute presentation of your replication plan. In the presentation, you are expected to discuss, but not limited to, the following items:

1. Overview of the original study, with a focus on its analysis methods.
2. Where you will spend most of your time and why.
3. The design of your replication.
4. Expected results.
5. How the replication project ties to your learning plan.
<!-- 6. Teamwork and division of labor. -->

Your presentation will be assessed from 1) significance, 2) novel contribution, 3) analysis of the original article, 4) feasibility of replication.

<br>


## 4.2 Present your replication

Prepare a 15-minute presentation of your replication, which should emphasize:

1. Overview of the original study and its significance.
2. Analysis of your replication. (a) The design of your replication, what are the differences in comparison to the original study, and why you are making these changes. (b) The results of your replication, the differences in comparison to the original study, and your interpretations about the differences. (c) Your data management and documentation, and how they support the replication and transparency of your project.
3. Teamwork and division of labor.
4. Your intellectual growth through the customized learning and replication project.

The class audience will [use this form](https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_77EJQrBapfriEZM) to evaluate your presentation, which will be used in grading.

<!-- ## 4.3 Verify replications

Your replication report itself needs to be replicable. Each group will be assigned to verify another group's replication and provide a verification report. Ideally, your group should be able to replicate another group's project with the information provided in the replication report. The verification report should point out, for example:

- Whether you can or cannot run through the replication study, and why. You don't have be crystal clear about the other group's analysis, but there should be no obstacles for running the analysis through.
- Whether the theorization and operationalization are sound and clear.
- Whether the analysis is robust.
- Whether the findings and conclusions are valid and robust.
- How the replication study can be improved.

The purpose of the verification report is to provide concrete feedback on how to improve the replication report. So be constructive, insightful, and concise. *No page limit but 2 pages are expected if excluding tables and figures.* All groups will revise and finalize their replication reports using the feedback from the verification reports.

<br> -->

<!-- ## 4.2 Final replication report (20%)

Use the [published replication studies](/replication_example/#example-studies) that are close to your areas of interest as references.

Generally, your manuscript should include two parts: a main text published as a regular printed journal article, and an appendix usually published online. 

The main text summarizes, for example:

	a. Theories and significance of the research topic/question.
	b. How original study(s) responded to the research gaps and challenges.
	c. Your replication contribution.
	d. The research design of your replication, and how it ties to your contribution.
	e. Research findings, comparison to original findings, and interpretations.
	f. Discuss the implications and limitations of your replication, and the directions for future studies (either replication or original study).

The appendix reports all technical details that are necessary for replicating and verifying your work. Please also include a Contributor Roles Taxonomy (e.g., [page 3 of this document](https://airtable.com/shrl5UMskMvXAQtJZ/tblRP1FEjVqLJj4Oc/viwP8TKBc1fVjs8By/rec8w5b2URfH3nKOc/fldhLKSsSRj1AwSAO/attHArL66gTQO6WAy?backgroundColor=blue&viewControls=on)) and any other documents that you want to present to us.

There is no required format for the report, but a few suggestions on formatting and submission:

	- Include page numbers, all figures and tables need a title (see other studies as examples).
	- Do not use excessive decimal positions when presenting numbers (up to 3 valid decimal positions is more than enough, e.g., 0.000123).
	- Tables and figures should be mentioned in the context of the report (A figure/table does not explain by itself, you guide the reader to understand/read/interpret tables and figures). 
	- Organize all the files in one single directory with full documentation (e.g., "readme" files and annotations in code scripts). You are expected to submit that single directory as a compressed file (e.g., .zip file) via Canvas.

## 4.3 Replication resources

The replication movement has been progressing very well in psychology, but you should be able to find replication studies in policy and public administration related areas. Here are some resources for your reference:

- [Peer-reviewed example replication studies](/replication_example)
- [Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/)
- [Mass Replications & Extensions (social psychology)](https://mgto.org/pre-registered-replications/)
- "Cited by" articles of the course readings.

## 4.4 Bonus points for non-Early-Pass students

For non-Early-Pass students, you can join a replication project and get up to 5 bonus points. The lead Early-Pass students are solely responsible for the projects' final quality.
1. An itemized responsibility agreement with the project lead (attach as an appendix of the replication plan).
2. Upon completion, non-Early-Pass students can get up to 5 points added to their final grade.


## Prepare articles for replications

Start to choose the article for the replication project. Prepare either ONE of the following items OR all the items for sharing next week. The general idea of this task is to push you to start--"Rome wasn't built in a day."

- An oral introduction about your replication interests, directions, and methods, etc.
- An oral introduction about the article(s) you may choose, why you choose them, and your replication plan.
- A short rough presentation about your replication plan.

_This after-class activity is NOT for grading, just for in-class sharing and discussion. This activity helps you prepare the replication plan, but it is NOT the replication plan. The articles you select are tentative. You can do it either individually or in a group. If you do this activity in a group, this activity helps you form a group, but the group may NOT be the final group for the replication project._
