<hr />

<h2 id="statement-on-learning-success">Statement on Learning Success</h2>

<p>Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need to be adaptable because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we‚Äôll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect you with a person or Center if you would like.</p>

<h2 id="statement-on-flexibility">Statement on Flexibility</h2>

<p>In acknowledgment of COVID 19 and its impact on the University of Texas at Austin community, this course will reaffirm one of the core values here at UT Austin: responsibility. Our responsibility to ourselves and each other is to put our humanity in the forefront of our academic pursuits. With that being said, this semester I commit to being adaptable in this time of great need, which is reflected in the course policies below around attendance, grading, and assignments/exams.</p>

<p>If you experience any hardships such as illness, accident, family crisis please know that these policies may be amended and therefore you should communicate with me as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing with me, please visit Student Emergency Services.</p>

<p>For additional campus resources, please visit https://coronavirus.utexas.edu/students.</p>

<h1 id="absences">Absences</h1>
<hr />

<p>Being present during in-person and synchronous online meetings is critical to achieving our goals for this course. You are welcome to utilize one (1) class absence during the semester as needed without explanation to me. In this case, you will be allowed to make up assignments or participation points you may have missed during this session. In addition to participating in synchronous meetings, you can earn participation points through assignments and asynchronous discussions. However, please keep in mind that if you miss multiple classes, you will begin to see a dip in your attendance and participation points.</p>

<p>If you are absent on the day that your team meets, you are responsible for providing your team with the necessary information to compensate for your absence. It is crucial to keep in communication with your team members; you are responsible for letting both us and your team know if you cannot make it to a class.</p>

<p><em>Excused Absence</em>: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious holidays or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will not be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible for any work you will miss on that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.</p>

<p><em>If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely</em>. Ask your team and other classmates to get a run-down and notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there are topics that we covered while you were gone that raise questions, you may come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to discuss. Email specific questions you have in advance so that we can make the most of our time. ‚ÄúWhat did I miss?‚Äù is not specific enough.</p>

<h1 id="personal-pronouns">Personal Pronouns</h1>
<hr />

<p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student‚Äôs legal name, unless they have added a ‚Äúpreferred name‚Äù with the Gender and Sexuality Center, which you can do so here: http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and- resources/). I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns.</p>

<h1 id="university-resources-for-students">University Resources for Students</h1>
<hr />

<p><em>Land Acknowledgment</em></p>

<p>I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on Indigenous land. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge and pay my respects to the Carrizo &amp; Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan, Caddo, Tonkawa, Comanche, Lipan Apache, Alabama- Coushatta, Kickapoo, Tigua Pueblo, and all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who have been or have become a part of these lands and territories in Texas, here on Turtle Island.</p>

<p><em>Land Engagements and/or Commitments</em></p>

<p>In recognition of the ongoing and cumulative challenges faced by Indigenous Peoples in Central Texas and globally, we call upon The University of Texas at Austin:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To repatriate the ancestral remains held by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory to their Indigenous descendant communities and Native lands.</li>
  <li>To commit to the active recruitment and material support of Native American and Indigenous students, who currently comprise fewer than 0.2% of UT Austin‚Äôs student body.
‚Ä¢	To support the transition of the Program in Native American and Indigenous Studies into a Center.
‚Ä¢	To establish a protocol of research and study on Tribal or Native lands, and to foster an ethics and practice of engaged scholarship, with and for Indigenous peoples and communities, locally and internationally.</li>
</ul>

<p>Services for Students with Disabilities
The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive learning environment consistent with university policy and federal and state law. Please let me know if you experience any barriers to learning so I can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully in this course. If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD). Please refer to SSD‚Äôs website for contact and more information: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you are already registered with SSD, please deliver your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in the semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this course.</p>

<p>Counseling and Mental Health Center
The Counseling and Mental Health Center serves UT‚Äôs diverse campus community by providing high quality, innovative and culturally informed mental health programs and services that enhance and support students‚Äô well- being, academic and life goals.

<p>Concerns and COVID-19 Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If something doesn‚Äôt feel right ‚Äì it probably isn‚Äôt. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.</p>

<p>The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/</p>

<p>Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢	Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
‚Ä¢	Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
‚Ä¢	In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
‚Ä¢	Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency</p>

<p>Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature occurs in our community, the university can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.</li>
  <li>Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.</li>
  <li>Investigate and discipline violations of the university‚Äôs relevant policies.</li>
</ol>

<p>Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, report any information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419.</p>

<p>Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, including the types of conduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors.</p>

<p>Emergency Evacuation Procedures
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512- 471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/</p>

<p>University Policies</p>

<p>Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: ‚ÄúAs a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.‚Äù Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT‚Äôs Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address: https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php</p>

<p>Q Drop Policy (modified for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters)
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you‚Äôll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester, but has been extended for the spring 2021 semester to May</p>
<ol>
  <li>Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution‚Äî however, for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, all Q-drops will be considered ‚Äúnon-academic,‚Äù which allows students to drop a class without counting toward the six-class limit. For more information about Q drops in general, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop. For information about fall 2020 and spring 2021 updates to the Q Drop Policy, see: https://t.e2ma.net/message/r3htee/j51jb0.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit Grading Policy
For the spring 2021 semester, undergraduate students may choose to have a total of three (3) classes graded on a Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit basis without penalty. These exceptions are new and apply only to the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters. For more information please visit UT‚Äôs policy on the Extended deadline for Q-drops and P/F Flexibility.</p>
